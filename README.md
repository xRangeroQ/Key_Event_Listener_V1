# Key_Event_Listener_V1

## 📌 Purpose
This project demonstrates a **basic key event listener** in C++.  
It is designed to detect specific key inputs and exit the program when certain keys are pressed.  
The goal is to provide a simple example for beginners learning about event handling and keyboard input in console applications.

---

## 🧐 What Does It Do?
- Listens for keyboard events in a console application.
- Exits the program when a predefined key (e.g., `ESC`) is pressed.
- Provides a minimal and easy-to-understand implementation for handling key events.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program runs in a loop, waiting for user input.
2. When a key is pressed, the listener checks if it matches the exit condition.
3. If the exit key is detected, the program terminates gracefully.
